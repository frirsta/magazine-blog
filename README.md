# Magazine
Magazine is a website where people share and get inspired by interior designs. The website is targeted toward those who want to share, read and learn about interior design. The website is useful for those who want to know what is trending right now. 
All website users can create an account and share what their homes look like or anything regarding interior design.

The website owner can delete comments and posts, if it is inappropriate. This is done from the Admin Dashboard that is only accessible to the Website owner when they log in.
